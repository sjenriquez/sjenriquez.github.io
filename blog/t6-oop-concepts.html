	      		<h2>A House of Cards & Jenga - Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming</h2>

	      		<p>There are two things I should say right off the bat. One, I had to include a reference to Whoomp There It Is in a blog about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) because that's what I hear in my head EVERY TIME I SEE OOP. If you're lucky, this song will play through your head too, well kinda lucky. Second, on a more serious note, I am in no way an expert on OOP or Functional Programming (FP). At the time of this writing, I am but a mere novice with OOP. My only real experience in FP was when I made games on my TI-82 while bored in High School math class.</p>

	      		<p>With that said, let's dive right in. I like analogies. In trying to visualize OOP vs FP, my mind fell on the game of Jenga and a house of cards. I see OOP similar to Jenga and FP similar to a house of cards. In Ruby, an Object Oriented Language, everything is an object. We write chunks of code that hold their data and can function independently of the whole. Even though other objects or blocks of code might not work, others will probably still function. Kinda like Jenga right? We can add and take away blocks but the tower still stands until we really just have an unstable tower.</p>

	      		<p>FP on the other hand might be more like a house of cards. I might be offending a lot of programmers out there with this analogy. I don't intend to, FP isn't inherently unstable. I relate it to a house of cards only because in FP we have many classes that make the whole. Classes work together, if you take out a class the whole might not function.</p>

	      		<p>OOP and FP each have their strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, good design reigns supreme. FP can be written to model OOP, and vice versa. Without good design, every programming paradigm will be difficult to maintain.</p>
