	      		<h2>Fulfilling Your Potential</h2>
	      		<h3>11/16/14</h3>

	      		<p>Stereotype threat can dramatically affect your potential. Growing up half-Mexican I sometimes got caught up feeling like I couldn't perform as well as my mainstream peers. Luckily, I had great parents and great friends that supported my endeavors. But, those feeling were still there, and identifying them was crucial in surpassing their weight.</p>

	      		<p>Programming is a lot like a spoken language and seems like way more than just a diffrent spoken language to a lot of people. People are sometimes intimidated by programming. But, I really believe that it is simply a language to learn. There are conventions and gramatically correct ways to communicate in all languages. The same is true for computer programming. We should not be intimidated by learning computer languages! We humans are the ones that make computers smart.</p>

	      		<p>After this journey in to Ruby, I'd love to be involved in making this path accessible to a younger generation of minorities who may be intimidated in similar ways I was as a kid. Kids these days are so hyper connected to technology and quick to adopt new tech, they're ALL ripe to learn how to make their smart phones smart.</p>
