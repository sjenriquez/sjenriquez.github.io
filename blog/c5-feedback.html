	    		<h1>DBC Pairing & Feedback</h1>
	      		<h2>Get over the hump</h2>
	      		<h3>11/6/14</h3>

	      		<p>Pairing can be awkward at first. As a DBC student, you're most likely pairing remotely in Phase 0 and this adds a bit more to the weird feeling of working on a group project. If you've done a lot of video conferencing or meetings then maybe this will seem more natural. The good thing is, it gets better with time. Not only does working remotely in a group become more normal, but you also get more comfortable with Ruby. When you're working on challenges alone you can take your time, make mistakes, talk out loud, be silent, basically work the way most comfortable for you. In pair programming someone else is there, so talking through challenges is important, even if it feels unnatural at first. The good thing is, when you get through the challenge, you build a sense of camaraderie with your fellow boot. Even though it may take some time to become comfortable working with someone else on something so new, that feeling of vulnerability and exposure turns in to support and team building.</p>

	      		<p>The other side of the pair programming is giving and receiving feedback. If you've had a lot of experience in the workplace this may not feel very foreign to you. For me, it felt like a much more structured version of reviews in the workplace. The big difference being that while you will probably have reviews with your supervisors, you probably won't ever have reviews with your other co-workers. Feedback from peers may lead to a better employee/student. If you're already sensitive to office politics and dynamics feedback may seem a bit excessive. If you're not, you might benefit from hearing what your peers have to say. In DBC feedback follows the guidelines of Actionable, Specific, and Kind. These are important guidelines as giving and receiving feedback can feel very personal.</p>

	      		<p>Working full time during Phase 0, time is extremely tight. Personally, I think I would benefit more from less pairing and feedback (giving) requirements. Pairing can take longer than working alone, and sometimes 2 confused people simply leads to 2 confused people and a lot of googling. I would definitely benefit from pairing with someone who grasped a concept that I struggled with.</p>
