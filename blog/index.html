	      		<p>Everyone likes hash browns right? I'm sorry if you don't, you're really missing out. Personally I like mine extra crispy from some greasy griddle. In this post I'm going to show you how to organize you favorite hash brown recipes to make at home. And when your home hash won't cut it, we'll keep track of your favorite diners by neighborhood. To do this we will store these lists in <span class="code">array</span>'s and <span class="code">hash</span>es...</p>

	      		<p>My experience in Phase 0 at DBC has been great so far. My previous experience in HTML/CSS combined with studying basic Ruby for the interviews and application process has made Phase 0 pretty straight forward. The biggest challenge for me is time. Specifically, balancing a full-time job with the necessary DBC time. I'm thinking of it as practice for Phase 1 (and 2). I know that the workload will ramp up very quickly when the in-person phases begin. I've been using Phase 0 mostly as time management practice. So far so good!</p>

	      		<h2>Inline vs Inline-block (vs Block)</h2>
	      		<h3>10/19/14</h3>
	      		<p>Getting you content and containers to layout just how you'd like them to isn't always strightforward. Today I'll break down one aspect of laying out your content with the display property.</p>

	      		<p>There are three main display properties to know: <span class="code">inline</span>, <span class="code">inline-block</span>, and <span class="code">block</span>. A <span class="code">block</span>-level element has a definable width and height and are displayed on their own line. Think of <span class="code">block</span> displayed elements like the subway rider...</p>

	      		<p>If you've seen the 90's movie PCU, you might remember the scene where the accident-prone protagonist trips on the computer lab's power cord and shuts off everyone's computer mid-thesis. This wouldn't be the best way to make friends in college, or the workplace. And let's be honest, people forget to save their docs. But, saving documents and projects is a lot easier these days. Word attempts to auto-recover your last unsaved version, Google Docs is always saving, your programs have gotten smarter. In the world of code, git & GitHub are popular ways to powerfully manage and save versions and revisions to your code. Similar to Time Machine on macs, git let's you step back to previous versions of files and when combined with GitHub, you can easily share and non-destructively work on the same files with other people... <a href="./t1-git-blog.html">MORE</a></p>

	      		<p>I was drawn to Dev Bootcamp because of their holistic approach. It reminds me of west coast culture! I'm looking forward to attending an intense program with this supportive environment. We're all cooking in the kitchen together, but this ain't Hell's Kitchen!</p>
