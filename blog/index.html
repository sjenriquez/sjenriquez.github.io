	      		<p>If you've seen the 90's movie PCU, you might remember the scene where the accident-prone protagonist trips on the computer lab's power cord and shuts off everyone's computer mid-thesis. This wouldn't be the best way to make friends in college, or the workplace. And let's be honest, people forget to save their docs. But, saving documents and projects is a lot easier these days. Word attempts to auto-recover your last unsaved version, Google Docs is always saving, your programs have gotten smarter. In the world of code, git & GitHub are popular ways to powerfully manage and save versions and revisions to your code. Similar to Time Machine on macs, git let's you step back to previous versions of files and when combined with GitHub, you can easily share and non-destructively work on the same files with other people.</p>

				<p>I like to visually represent git & GitHub like the classic game Frogger. When you change to a file and track it with git, you jump across a lane towards your remote repository. Sometime you might want to jump back a lane and take a different path. No problem, jump back to a previous version with git commands, then start tracking you new path. When you've made all the changes you want to make you can push these changes to your remote repository on GitHub, and BOOM, you've reached the other side of the street without getting run over!</p>

				<p>With your code/files stored on your GitHub account, you can share everything with other people. They get their own copy of the code on their repository (they forked your repository), and they can make changes independently of your changes. At some point they can ask you to compare and review the changes they've made to the original files they forked. GitHub makes it easy to evaluate the changes and then "merge" these changes in to the original if you so choose.</p>

				<p>In the end, git and GitHub make it safe and easy to work through projects individually or collaboratively. And there's much less fear of losing everything is someone trips over and unplugs your power cord!</p>
