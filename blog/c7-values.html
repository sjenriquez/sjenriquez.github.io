	      		<h2>What is important</h2>
	      		<h3>11/22/14</h3>
	      		<p>I find Self-knowledge is important to me. I believe knowing yourself is the foundation to living freely.</p>

	      		<p>In general I try to live up to these values:<br>
	      		Self-knowledge - 5. Agree<br>
	      		Coolness-under-fire - 5. Agree<br>
	      		Creativity - 5. Agree<br>
	      		Health - 5. Agree<br>
	      		Self-respect - 5. Agree<br>
	      		</p>

	      		<p>Advice<br>
	      			My younger sisters ask me for advice pretty often. One of them is trying to move forward on her dreams of fashion design. She is trying get through the steps starting from moving out from home and choosing a path towards her dream. I've moved a bunch, including twice across the country, had various jobs, have started new careers a few times, and have experience starting new things. This is the general area that we talk about.
	      		</p>

	      		<p>I think it will be important to focus on the values I listed above while in DBC. It will be an intense, challenging, and humbling experience. I'm sure I will feel overwhelmed by the amount of material presented and by trying to absorb it all. Coolness-under-fire will be very important while coping with these stressors.</p>

	      		<p>Similar to stressful job situations, staying grounded will be important. I tend to power through my work, it will be important to take regular breaks to stay grounded, and sane!</p>
