	    		<h1>Conflict</h1>
	      		<h2>Dealing With Disputes</h2>
	      		<h3>11/28/14</h3>

				<p>Conflict in life is inevitable. Like stress you can't avoid it, you must learn how to handle it. Everyone develops defense mechanisms for conflict. One can hope through practice to approach conflicts without emotions overtaking reason. In researching conflict in the workplace, I've collected some of the strategies that resonated the most.</p>

	      		<p>1. Stay Calm.<br>
	      			This is definitely easier said than done. Emotions can get easily stirred when conflict arises. This may become easier with practice. Self awareness is an important aspect of remaining calm. Keeping tabs on stirred emotions, especially anger is important to keeping calm. Take self-checks when you're calm and wound up will be important to keep tabs when tensions rise.</p><br>

	      		<p>2. Be Respectful.<br>
	      			Being respectful of everyone's points of view and differences is important to work through conflict. Nothing will set off defenses like a personal attack. This brings us to the next similar point.</p><br>

	      		<p>3. Don't Get Personal<br>
	      			It's important to stay on point. Keep your discussion focused on the topic at hand and do not bring in personal attacks.</p><br>

	      		<p>4. Be Confident<br>
	      			While maintaining a respectful exchange in a calm manner, hold to your guns! Working through conflict doesn't mean to let yourself get pushed over. While it's important to respect others it's just as important to respect yourself.</p><br>

	      		<p>5. Listen, really.<br>
	      			This is really the meat of conflict resolution. Listening intently to the other person is paramount in resolving conflict. Being an actively engaged listener not only helps you communicate effectively, but can also help you stay focused on the issue at hand, be self aware, and keep from getting lost in emotion.</p><br>

	      		<p>Practice makes perfect. I'm not suggesting you go out and seek conflict just for practice. But, you will inevitably find some source of conflict, take each time as a chance to get better with resolution.</p>
